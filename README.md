A react-like multipurpose website (built with vanilla JavaScript) with features like file uploader, Instagram video downloader, wallpaper downloader, user registration system etc. that I'd worked on during my school days during 2017-2018. <br>Did not finish due losing access to my device.
<br>Some features are broken due to not being updated in over 5 years.
